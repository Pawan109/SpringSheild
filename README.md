## **Project Overview**

SpringShield is a **secure authentication and authorization system** built using **Java Spring Boot**, focusing on **token-based authentication (JWT, Refresh Tokens)** and **role-based access control (RBAC)**. It ensures **secure API access** while enabling **real-time event-driven security monitoring** via **Apache Kafka**. The system integrates **Docker for containerization**, ensuring scalability and seamless deployment. A **design-first approach** was used, leveraging sequence diagrams to optimize workflows before development.

## **Features**

- **Microservices**: Implements authentication and authorization as independent services, ensuring modularity and scalability.
    
- **RESTful APIs**: Designed for secure login, token management, user roles, and authentication lifecycle.
    
- **Database Integration**: Uses a relational database to store users, roles, tokens, and authentication logs.
    
- **Kafka Messaging**: Publishes authentication events (e.g., login, token refresh) for real-time security monitoring.
    
- **Design-First Approach**: Built **sequence diagrams** before development to streamline the authentication flow and system interactions.

## **System Workflow**

1. **User Registration & Authentication**: Users sign up or log in via the `AuthController`, triggering role and token creation.
    
2. **Token Generation & Storage**: Upon successful authentication, a JWT access token and refresh token are generated and stored.
    
3. **Event Logging with Kafka**: Authentication events (e.g., successful login, failed login) are published to Kafka for monitoring.
    
4. **Access Control & Role Management**: API requests are validated using JWT tokens and user roles via `SecurityConfig` and `JWT Filter`.
    
5. **Token Refresh Handling**: Expired tokens trigger a refresh flow, verifying validity before generating a new JWT.
    
6. **Authorization Enforcement**: Role-based access controls (RBAC) ensure users can access only permitted resources.
    
7. **Session & Security Monitoring**: Kafka consumers listen for security-related events and trigger alerts when anomalies occur.
    
8. **Database Persistence**: User details, tokens, and authentication logs are stored in a secure database.
    
9. **Scalability & Deployment**: Dockerized services allow seamless deployment and scaling across environments.
    
10. **Security Context Management**: The `SecurityContextHolder` maintains user authentication details throughout the session.

## **Key Components**
1. Authentication Service
- Handles user registration, login, and logout processes.
- Generates and validates JWT access tokens and refresh tokens.
- Implements Spring Security for authentication and authorization enforcement.
- Stores user credentials securely in a relational database.

2. Token Management System
- Manages JWT token lifecycle, including expiration and refresh token rotation.
- Provides secure storage and retrieval of refresh tokens in the database.
- Ensures secure API access by verifying tokens with each request.

3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System
- Defines and manages user roles and permissions.
- Enforces access restrictions using Spring Security filters.
- Ensures role-based authorization for API endpoints.

4. Kafka Event Logging System
- Publishes authentication-related events (e.g., successful login, failed login attempts).
- Kafka consumers listen for security anomalies (e.g., multiple failed logins).
- Enables real-time monitoring of authentication activity.

5. API Gateway & Security Filters
- Acts as the entry point for all authentication requests.
- Implements Spring Security filters to validate JWTs before processing requests.
- Uses SecurityContextHolder to store user authentication details.

6. Database Management System
- Stores user details, roles, tokens, and authentication logs.
- Ensures secure encryption and storage of sensitive user data.
- Uses PostgreSQL/MySQL for structured and scalable data storage.

7. Dockerized Deployment System
- Containerizes the authentication service using Docker for seamless deployment.
- Ensures scalability and portability across different environments.
- Simplifies deployment and configuration with Docker Compose.
